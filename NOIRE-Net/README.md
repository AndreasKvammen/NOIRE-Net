## NOIRE-Net
Contains the trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), jointly named NOIRE-Net. NOIRE-Net consists of CNNs specialized for 4 different tasks. 10 Networks were trained for each task. These networks are organized in subfolders named by their task:
- E-classify: contains the trained NOIRE-Net E-region classification networks
- F-classify: contains the trained NOIRE-Net F-region classification networks
- E-scale: contains the trained NOIRE-Net E-region scaling networks
- F-scale: contains the trained NOIRE-Net F-region scaling networks
